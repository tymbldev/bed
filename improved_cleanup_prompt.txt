Analyze the company name "%s" and determine if it's:

1. A PRODUCT/SERVICE name that should be mapped to its parent company
2. A junk/incorrect entry that should be deleted
3. A valid company name that should remain unchanged
4. A company name with extra descriptive text that should be cleaned up

IMPORTANT: Focus on identifying products, services, platforms, or tools that belong to larger companies.

NEW: COMPANY NAME CLEANUP - Remove extra descriptive text that shouldn't be part of the official company name.

Examples of COMPANY NAMES THAT NEED CLEANUP:
- "Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) (for IT related roles)" → Clean to: "Tata Consultancy Services" or "TCS"
  Reason: The extra phrase "(for IT related roles)" is descriptive text that should not be part of the official company name.
- "Google (Alphabet Inc.)" → Clean to: "Google" or "Alphabet"
  Reason: Parenthetical company structure information should be simplified.
- "Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)" → Clean to: "Microsoft"
  Reason: Stock ticker symbols should not be part of the company name.
- "Apple Inc. (AAPL) - Technology Company" → Clean to: "Apple"
  Reason: Stock ticker and descriptive phrases should be removed.
- "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) - E-commerce Giant" → Clean to: "Amazon"
  Reason: Legal suffixes and descriptive text should be removed.
- "Meta Platforms, Inc. (formerly Facebook)" → Clean to: "Meta"
  Reason: Legal suffixes and "formerly" information should be removed.
- "Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) - Streaming Service" → Clean to: "Netflix"
  Reason: Legal suffixes and descriptive phrases should be removed.
- "Salesforce.com, Inc. (CRM)" → Clean to: "Salesforce"
  Reason: Legal suffixes and stock tickers should be removed.
- "Adobe Systems Incorporated (ADBE)" → Clean to: "Adobe"
  Reason: Legal suffixes and stock tickers should be removed.
- "Oracle Corporation (ORCL) - Database Company" → Clean to: "Oracle"
  Reason: Legal suffixes, stock tickers, and descriptive text should be removed.

CLEANUP RULES:
1. Remove parenthetical descriptive text like "(for IT related roles)", "(technology company)", etc.
2. Remove stock ticker symbols like "(GOOGL)", "(MSFT)", "(AAPL)", etc.
3. Remove legal suffixes like "Inc.", "Corp.", "LLC", "Ltd." when they're not essential
4. Remove "formerly" or "previously" information
5. Remove descriptive phrases like "- E-commerce Giant", "- Technology Company", etc.
6. Keep the core, recognizable company name
7. Prefer shorter, more commonly used names (e.g., "Google" over "Alphabet Inc.")
